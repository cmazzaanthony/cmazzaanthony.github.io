stability and weakening interactions with PolyQ domain."

excerpt: 'Huntington’s disease is a fatal autosomal genetic disorder characterized by an 
expanded glutamine-coding CAG repeat sequence in the huntingtin (Htt) exon 1 gene. 
The Htt protein associated with the disease misfolds into toxic oligomers and aggregate 
fibril structures. Competing models for the misfolding and aggregation phenomena have 
suggested the role of the Htt-N-terminal region and the CAG trinucleotide repeats 
(polyQ domain) in affecting aggregation propensities and misfolding. In particular, one 
model suggests a correlation between structural stability and the emergence of toxic 
oligomers, whereas a second model proposes that molecular interactions with the extended 
polyQ domain increase aggregation propensity. In this paper, we computationally explore 
the potential to reduce Htt aggregation by addressing the aggregation causes outlined in 
both models. We investigate the mutation landscape of the Htt-N-terminal region and explore 
amino acid residue mutations that affect its structural stability and hydrophobic 
interactions with the polyQ domain. Out of the millions of 3-point mutation combinations 
that we explored, the (L4K E12K K15E) was the most promising mutation combination that 
addressed aggregation causes in both models. The mutant structure exhibited extreme 
alpha-helical stability, low amyloidogenicity potential, a hydrophobic residue replacement, 
and removal of a solvent-inaccessible intermolecular side chain that assists oligomerization.'
