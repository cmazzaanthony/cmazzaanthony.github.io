Mastering probability is as close as one gets to having a super power. It's one of those increasingly useful skills that you can apply to your everyday life. You can use it to determine the outcome of certain events, win big at the casino, and even use it to stop the mighty Thanos from wiping out half the universe! Kidding.  Essentially, what I am saying is probability is how you quantify/describe a random event. It's a language and a foresight that allows you to make informed decisions and to, quite possibly, know what happens before it happens.

Let's start with an example!

I love comic books so all the examples in this blog series will be centered around comics, cinematic universes, and all pop culture goodness that comes with being a self-professed geek! I assume a lot of readers are familiar with such, so let's jump right into it. Assume, for instance, Iron Man is facing off with the mad titan Thanos, who already possesses all six infinity stones. During their fiery battle, the goal for Stark is to prevent Thanos from snapping his fingers, and to ensure this, all Iron Man needs is ONE out of SIX stones!

Now, since Thanos is the toughest bad guy around, we will consider this liaison as a ``random event''. Iron Man is all on his own without Thor, Captain Marvel, and the other avengers, thereby we assume that Iron Man can only acquire one of the six infinity stones and flee before Thanos obliterates him. We must also state that acquiring only one of the six infinity stones from Thanos are \textbf{equally likely outcomes}. We must also note that this battle is \textbf{easily repeatable} and that in each battle the outcomes do \textbf{not} change.

Lots to take in? Welcome to Math, and don't worry. It gets easier.

We will refer to this battle as an ``experiment''. In this experiment, there are \textbf{six} possible outcomes: acquiring the soul stone, time stone, space stone, mind, reality and power stones. After one battle with Thanos, I ask, what is the probability of acquiring, let's say, the mind stone?

And, after two more battles with the tyrannical Thanos, what is the probability of acquiring the time and space stones too? By the end of the blog, you will be able to answer both these questions. First, a little notation. -->
