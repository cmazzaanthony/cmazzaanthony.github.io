Mastering probability is as close as one gets to having a super power. It's one of those increasingly useful skills that you can apply to your everyday life. You can use it to determine the outcome of certain events, win big at the casino, and even use it to stop the mighty Thanos from wiping out half the universe! Kidding.  Essentially, what I am saying is probability is how you quantify/describe a random event. It's a language and a foresight that allows you to make informed decisions and to, quite possibly, know what happens before it happens.
