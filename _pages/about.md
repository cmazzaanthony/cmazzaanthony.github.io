I am currently a Masters student in Electrical Engineering at McGill University, supervised by [Mark Coates](http://www.ece.mcgill.ca/~mcoate/).

I was a Technology Associate at Morgan Stanley after my undergraduate degree where I worked on the 
Credit Risk team. After that I moved to Squarepoint Capital where I have been working as a 
Quantitative Developer for the last three years.

Previously, I obtained a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Biology in 2015 from McGill University. During my 
undergraduate years I co-authored a computational biology paper with [Mohamed Smaoui](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~msmaou/) 
and [Jerome Waldispuhl](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jeromew/).
