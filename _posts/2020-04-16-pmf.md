When I first started studying statistics, I used the concept of 
random variables many times without really knowing what a random 
variable was. We used it in hypothesis testing, model fitting, 
and countless other domains. In this post, we will build off of 
our previously established probability foundations to understand 
just how important random variables are.

Let's begin with the formal definition 

**(Mathematical Definition)** A random variable is a **mapping** or **function**:

$$X: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$

that assigns a real number $X(\omega)$ to each outcome $\omega$.

$\Omega$ and $\omega$ should look familiar since we have discussed them at length in our previous posts. 
Nevertheless, this definition can be confusing for several reasons. First, what real numbers are we assigning each 
outcome to? Also, why do we assign any real number at all? Why do we **need** random variables?

All these questions will be answered, so just keep reading.

Let's tie this concept back to pop culture. In a previous post we discussed the Infinity Stones from the 
Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). These stones are central to the narrative arc that courses through the MCU's 
"Phases", also referred to as the "The Infinity Saga". Let's start by assigning a value to each of the 
infinity stones that represents their overall capabilities. 

Lets assume I assign the following overall scores: 

(a) Soul: 6 (most powerful)

(b) Power: 5

(c) Time: 4

(d) Mind: 3

(e) Reality: 2 

(f) Space: 1 (least powerful)

I think the reasons why I chose these values is for another day. 
**We let the random variable $X$ be the sum of scores of the two infinity stones chosen**. 
I realize that per universe there are only six stones, so let's also assume that we borrowed 6 identical 
stones from an alternate reality using the quantum realm. We know that there are 36 possible sample outcomes 
in our sample space $\Omega$:

| $\omega$          | $X(\omega)$   | 
| -------------     |:-------------:| 
| (Space, Space)    | 2             |
| (Space, Reality)  | 3             | 
| (Space, Mind)     | 4             | 
| (Space, Time)     | 5             |
| (Space, Power)    | 6             |
| (Space, Soul)     | 7             |
| ...               | ...           |
