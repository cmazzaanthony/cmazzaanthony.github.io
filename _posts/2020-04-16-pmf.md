When I first started studying statistics, I used the concept of 
random variables many times without really knowing what a random 
variable was. We used it in hypothesis testing, model fitting, 
and countless other domains. In this post, we will build off of 
our previously established probability foundations to understand 
just how important random variables are.

Let's begin with the formal definition
