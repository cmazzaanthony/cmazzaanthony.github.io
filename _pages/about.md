I am currently the team lead for the machine learning quantitative development group at [Squarepoint Capital](https://www.squarepoint-capital.com/). Our mandate is to build an automated machine learning pipeline designed for research. I graduated from McGill University with a Masters degree in Electrical Engineering supervised by [Mark Coates](http://www.ece.mcgill.ca/~mcoate/). My thesis focused primarily on identifying densely connected subsets of multivariate Gaussian random variables within a graphical model framework. This project involved various aspects of machine learning, statistics, and non-smooth convex optimization.

I recently completed my masters degree while employed and decided to take a six month sabbatical to focus on my thesis and to complete a [research internship](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/projects/statistical-learning-financial-time-series). During this time I was a quantitative developer on the Volatility trading desk at Squarepoint Capital. Before that, I was a Technology Associate at Morgan Stanley after completing my undergraduate degree where I worked on the Credit Risk team.

Previously, I obtained a Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science and Biology in 2015 from McGill. During my undergraduate years I co-authored and published a computational biology paper working alongside esteemed academics [Mohamed Smaoui](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrsmaoui/) and [Jerome Waldispuhl](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jeromew/).
